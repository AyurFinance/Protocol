# Protocol

A general Options protocol for all assets, DeFi or otherwise. A demo iOS app (hopefully)

# Features -

- Anyone can write an option for any whitelisted asset (can be anything from ETH, BTC, Apple, TSLA, Gold, Aramco, etc.) by submitting collateral, specifying expiry date, strike price, no. of options to mint.
- Minting an option will return them a tradeable ERC20 option Token, which can be freely traded anywhere.
- No. of underlying asset = No. of option tokens minted.
- v0 Protocol will only allow for all USD pegged stable coins like DAI, USDC, USDT as well as yield earning USD pegged stable coins like aDai, cDai, aUSDC, cUSDC, etc.
- Options are initially fully collateralized in USD. Amount of collateral = no. of options to mint * strike price
- Options can only be exercised upon expiry i.e. European options.
- All settlements will be in cash.

# Incentives for Options writers -

- Chance to earn additional income on their stablecoin with option premiums

# Incentives for Option buyers -

- Direct exposure to markets not currently tradable. Example - A US Citizen can get direct exposure to the Saudi Arabian Oil company by trading Aramco options on our platform as opposed to getting indirect exposure by investing in ETFs.
- Hedge against volatility(works for any asset, not just Crypto)
- Leverage 
- Speculation
- Complex complex trading strategies, like covered calls.

# Why?

- We want to build for simplicity
- Support more than just crypto. Hedge your sTSLA, sNTFLX, etc. by buying options here


# Our pitch for users of Opyn, Hedgic, & other existing DeFi option protocols

- Split options across protocols to diversify & hedge against DeFi risk. (risk of a protocol being hacked)
- Access via Mobile App?? (hopefully)
